## CV Submission

* Situation:
  I included a CV Submissions section in my digital portfolio 
  to show how and where I have submitted my CV for job opportunities.

* Task:
  Present a clear and structured overview of my application efforts 
  to demonstrate my proactive job-seeking behavior.

* Action:
  Collected information about each submission, including company names, 
  dates, and positions applied for. Designed the section in a table-like format 
  using consistent styles and icons for better visual impact.

* Result:
  The section shows my dedication and organization in applying for roles, 
  adding credibility to my portfolio and helping potential employers 
  see my commitment to career growth.
